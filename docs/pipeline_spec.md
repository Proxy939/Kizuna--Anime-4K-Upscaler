# Pipeline Specification

## Purpose
Defines the data flow and execution stages for the KizunaSR upscaling pipeline.

## Real-Time Shader Pipeline
For the complete specification of the real-time shader pipeline, see:
- **[Real-Time Shader Pipeline Design](realtime_shader_pipeline.md)**

This document covers:
- Five processing stages (Normalize, Structural Reconstruction, Real-Time Upscale, Perceptual Enhancement, Temporal Stabilization)
- Stage execution order and dependencies
- Performance constraints and optimization strategies
- Temporal stabilization approach
- Explicit non-goals

## AI Pipeline
*To be documented in future phases*
